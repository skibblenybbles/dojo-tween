dojo-tween
==========

A high-performance tweening engine with intuitive CSS3 support for Dojo.

# About

This is a work-in-progress. My inspirations are Dojo's dojo/_base/fx, dojo/fx and Greensock's TweenLite and TweenMax libraries.

My goals for this project are:

* high-performance tweening for HTML5 documents
* intuitive CSS3 property tweening (for transform, gradient, box-shadow, multiple backgrounds, etc.)
* generic tweening (using begin, update and end callbacks)
* simple, powerful syntax for defining complex animations
* support for animation combinations and chains
* robust browser support using dojo/has (has.js) feature detection
* modularity and extensibility

I'll be posting code and eventually some demos as I flesh this out.
